Things I would like to add, sorted from easiest to hardest:
- Drop down menu for top right usernames (logout, dark mode/light mode, etc.)
- DetailView
- Spruce up CSS
- Password Change
- Commenting
- Report Button
- Dark mode
- Likes, make sure users cannot like more than once
- Slugify urls
- User profile page, should include a list of the user's post history
- Group/topic pages, such as politics or history
- Sort group posts by most liked/most recent
- User profile image
- Allow users to include image and video in posts
- Allow users to sign up with accounts such as Gmail or Facebook (Auth0)
- Creating a post appears in a pop-up as opposed to an entirely new page (JavaScript?)
- Posting Algorithm
